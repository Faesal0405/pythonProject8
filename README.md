To be able to start the Chat bot, you must first open the terminal. You can get help about how to start chatbot.
Start with typing "python3 server -h portnr".
Start by running server.py in the terminal.

After starting the server, the server will go into listening mode and wait for connections. The server shows if anyone is connected.

You need to open a terminal window for the host client and you can call the host whatever you want.
You can open more than one, but it takes one to start the Chat bot.

After you have opened a host client in the terminal window, you must open at least one bot to be able to write/chat to and get a response. 
You can open 4 bots and all bots will respond to you at the same time.
You need to give the botâ€™s name as an argument to be able to start the client side of the bot.
You can write for. Ex (python3 client.py localhost portnr bot-name).

After opening the host and bot windows, check if the server is listening to the clients.
You can write whatever you want in the chat to the bots, but you will get the same answer if you do not write something that is not stated in the good and bad action lists.

If you type a word that is in the list, the fines will respond differently.

You can end the Chat bot by typing "exit" in the host window.
